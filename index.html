    <summary>on listening</summary>
    how do you listen? the closest form of memory i have is sound. listening is active, patient, transcendent. i think listening alone isn't enough to awaken an experience — there needs to be some transcendent activation that shows that you are not just passive — but your ear is attuned to all the fine details — the scale, physicality, and grandeur of the world. here, the textural, environmental, and personal all blend into one. the ways in which we experience a sound is mended with all that we are and all that is around, all we have yet to be. there is minimal noise, because anything that is 'noise' becomes a wanted part of the composition. there are no disturbances, everything is desired. you can participate in the sound, or let the world envelop you.
